Iâ€™m Dhurkeshâ€”a Machine Learning Engineer who thrives on turning complex challenges into innovative solutions. With over three years of experience under my belt, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to dive deep into the realms of AI and ML. My journey has been all about exploring how technology can make our lives easierâ€”whether itâ€™s through computer vision or natural language processing. At OptiSol Business Solutions, I developed and deployed deep learning models for object detection and instance segmentation using state-of-the-art architectures. One of my proudest moments was building a RAG application utilizing large language models that significantly enhanced our project outcomes. Itâ€™s rewarding to see how these technologies can transform ideas into tangible results. Before my current role, I interned at Zestix Fintech where I automated stock trading strategies that cut down the time to identify trending stocks from one minute to just five seconds! This experience taught me the importance of efficiency in tech solutionsâ€”something I carry with me in every project I tackle. I also had a stint at Takvaviya Analytics where I worked on crop detection using deep learning techniques. By optimizing our model's performance with open-source libraries, we managed to reduce runtime by an impressive 50%. These experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills but also fueled my passion for continuous learning in this fast-paced field. Outside of work, I'm always eager to explore new technologies and stay updated with industry trends. Whether itâ€™s attending workshops or collaborating on side projects with fellow tech enthusiasts, I believe that sharing knowledge is key to growth.

My educational journey began at Sainik School Nalanda in Bihar, where I consistently ranked in the top 10 percent of my class. After completing my 12th grade, I pursued a non- BTech degree at Delhi University but soon realised my passion for application-based learning, leading me to transfer to Plaksha University. At Plaksha, I developed a keen interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, which I have applied to various projects.For instance, during my visit to a decent-sized MSME, I observed the significance of dynamic pricing. To address the non-convergence issue in nonlinear objective functions, I developed an innovative algorithm integrating linear regression , polynomial regression, COBYLA and the Simplex method. This solution ensured global optimal convergence, enhancing the efficiency of pricing strategies. Currently, I am working on intelligent inventory management system software to help MSMEs avoid overstocking and under-stocking. Additionally, I am searching for innovative solution for non-invasive glucose monitoring system using AI to improve diabetes management. My technical skills include Python, PowerBI, machine learning, and deep learning as well as C, C++, MySQL, SQLite, Matlab, and Canva. These competencies, combined with my hands-on project experience, equip me to solve complex problems effectively. Beyond academics, I have represented my school and university in cricket and basketball, learning valuable lessons in teamwork and collaboration. My inquisitiveness and eagerness to explore new ideas drive my continuous learning and innovation. I have demonstrated a commitment to excellence and practical application of theoretical knowledge throughout my academic and professional journey. Notably, I developed a robust sales forecasting model using data from Corporation Favorita, achieving high accuracy and real-world application success. I was honoured as a Bharti Scholar by the Bharti Airtel Foundation and ranked 3rd in the All India Sainik School Entrance Exam.

The next part of my career was in Corporate Research and Software Development across the Aerospace and Automotive industries. I wrote proposals to obtain funding (up to USD 700K from NASA and the US DoD). I worked in multi-national and multi-cultural teams. I also managed a research relationship with a remotely located team. Through this phase, I developed strength in managing the execution of corporate research projects.
