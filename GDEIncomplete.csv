Currently serving as Research Cadre faculty at Symbiosis International University, Pune. Dr. Singh brings to his role a formidable academic foundation, having earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from G. B. Pant Engineering College, Pauri (an Autonomous engineering college of the Uttarakhand Government). His core mission spans Big Data Analytics, Biomedical Analytics, Higher Education, and the mathematical intricacies of fractal dimension—fields in which he has cultivated deep expertise and pedagogical leadership. As an academician at one of India’s top 25 universities, Dr. Singh has consistently shaped the intellectual landscape of data-driven research in higher education. His work bridges computational rigor with medical relevance, enabling institutions to harness complex datasets for transformative learning and discovery. Over the years, he has mentored emerging scholars, contributed to curriculum innovation, and positioned his research within global dialogues on analytics and applied science. At the heart of Dr. Singh’s academic journey lies a driving philosophy: that data, when ethically and intelligently applied, can illuminate the most intricate patterns of human health and behavior. He views education not merely as the transmission of knowledge, but as a generative force—one that equips learners to interrogate systems, challenge assumptions, and contribute meaningfully to society’s evolving needs. His work is animated by a conviction that the most consequential research emerges not from disciplinary silos, but from the fertile boundaries where computational power meets human complexity. His approach to Big Data is not merely as a technical challenge, but as a lens through which society's most pressing questions—about health, learning, and systemic understanding—can be reexamined with greater precision and depth. His research in fractal dimension and biomedical analytics exemplifies this ethos, offering nuanced insights into the complexity of biological systems and the promise of predictive modeling. Dr. Krishna Kumar Singh is available for select advisory roles, invited lectures, and collaborative research initiatives that align with his academic vision and institutional values.

Here it goes-  I was born and brought up in a small city in India where I first hand witnessed disparity between different classes of society.   In the first few years of my professional career, I tried to bridge those disparities by using the power of finance in catalyzing urban reform. I worked with Governments and Multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to set up financial institutions committed to developing smart infrastructure in Africa and Southeast Asia.  A firm believer in capital for social good and equitable education for every child, I later helped raise funds from individuals, corporations, and foundations for a global nonprofit. My passion for creating social change drove me towards setting up two non-profit organizations that work towards empowering the underprivileged community.   In 2019, I was selected as a part of the LGT fellowship cohort- a group of ten changemakers working around the globe to help create social change. In late 2020, I got sold on the promise of decentralization and permissionless systems spent the next year or so building multiple onchain products and communities. The products I've built have won grants from foundations of all major blockchains.  My vision for the next decade is to build at the frontier of technology and create protocols and structures to bring India and the world onchain.  When I am not talking about bringing the world onchain or sustainable social impact, I am talking about football, rock music, or my cross-country travels.

I am passionate about parenting and entrepreneurship.  Over the last four years I have been reading and writing around parenting. I find it extremely funny that we live in a world where parenting is taken for granted and every parent knows so little about a child. We don't understand  - the long term affects of eating food with mobile  - what calling a kid shy does to them  - why are 9/10 kids in South Asia getting glasses  - how does air pollution affect kids  - is mother's love important for a child?  From mid 2022 I started putting out my research as The Curious Parent.  - 5 min Hindi Podcast with 700,000+ listens in 6 months  - 1 min English reels on Instagram as harpreet_thecuriousparent  Before I turned a researcher I was the Founder and CEO of CoCubes, the platform connecting colleges and companies. I spent 12 years of my life building CoCubes with Vibhore who was my room mate at IIT Bombay. CoCubes was acquired in 2016 by Aon Hewitt in an all cash deal. Both Vibhore and I were awarded the IIT Bombay Young Alumni Entrepreneurship Award in 2018.   Penguin published our book on our journey called 'Lets Build a Company'. This became the number 1 bestseller in entrepreneurship category when it was released.  Over the last 8 years I have been a coach and angel investor in 50 odd start-ups including Ola, Ola Electric, Chaayos, Shopkirana, Bombay Shaving Company, Lokal, STOA, Entri and others.  After working with a million students in CoCubes I had realized that graduates 'can't change'. They are like a arrow shot from a bow. The more I researched, the more I found that the key to our adult behavior seemed to lie in our childhood. There exists only 'one kind of child' in this world. A child absorbed in doing something without need of praise, reward or fear. But this child is getting lost in our distracted world full of advertisements, candies and screens. And we need to desperately find that child.  After failing to convince my wife to live in the hills, I live in Mumbai with Bhakti and my daughter Diya. And I spend my time being around children and researching on parenting.",,,The Curious Parent,,Founder,,2025-11-04T08:23:48.472Z,,The Curious Parent,82089464,https://www.linkedin.com/company/82089464/,Founder,2022.05,,,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",,,"The Curious Parent Community is now over 1 million parents across Instagram and YouTube.  I find it extremely funny that we live in a world where parenting is taken for granted and a parent knows so little about a child. So I am spending my time in finding the OneKindofChild.   I see my friends running around, making time for kids between calls and presentations. I think parents today are busy, but all of them want the best for their child. Most parents won’t have as much time to spend as I have had.  At the start kids are shaped by their genetics and environment. And the environment (how kids spend their time, who do they play with, which school etc) is determined by the parents.  The idea of the curious parent is to share research on children and parenting which is usable in everyday life.
