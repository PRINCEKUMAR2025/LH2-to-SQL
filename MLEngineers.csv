When I actually understand what users need and what business problems we're solving, I end up building way better ML systems. And having the technical background helps me figure out what's realistic to build with AI versus what's just hype. It's that sweet spot that really motivates me. 💡  Outside of work, I'm usually buried in a book 📚 or binge-watching stand-up specials 😄. Good storytelling just hits different, you know?

This involved creating a sophisticated architecture with components like a Contextual Query Generator, hierarchical intent classification, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), using Transformer-based models and GPT-3.5 turbo.  I also led the development of a Journey Gamification system, introducing a level-based structure to enhance user retention. By deploying a neural network-based personalized high-value action recommendation model, we saw a 0.12% improvement in C/UV and a 2.2% increase in monthly retention during online A/B testing.  In the fashion category, I developed a size and fit recommendation system using customer feedback and product features, resulting in improved F1 scores and a 33bps reduction in return rates. Additionally, I created an auto-answering system for user queries, implemented across the Mobiles vertical, improving both engagement and conversions.  Other highlights include building a non-personalized review ranking system, leading to an 11bps improvement in net conversion, and personalizing the Super Coin Zone through an FTRL-based online learning model, which boosted CTR and reduced bounce rates.

I am passionate about parenting and entrepreneurship.  Over the last four years I have been reading and writing around parenting. I find it extremely funny that we live in a world where parenting is taken for granted and every parent knows so little about a child. We don't understand  - the long term affects of eating food with mobile  - what calling a kid shy does to them  - why are 9/10 kids in South Asia getting glasses  - how does air pollution affect kids  - is mother's love important for a child?  From mid 2022 I started putting out my research as The Curious Parent.  - 5 min Hindi Podcast with 700,000+ listens in 6 months  - 1 min English reels on Instagram as harpreet_thecuriousparent  Before I turned a researcher I was the Founder and CEO of CoCubes, the platform connecting colleges and companies. I spent 12 years of my life building CoCubes with Vibhore who was my room mate at IIT Bombay. CoCubes was acquired in 2016 by Aon Hewitt in an all cash deal. Both Vibhore and I were awarded the IIT Bombay Young Alumni Entrepreneurship Award in 2018.   Penguin published our book on our journey called 'Lets Build a Company'. This became the number 1 bestseller in entrepreneurship category when it was released.  Over the last 8 years I have been a coach and angel investor in 50 odd start-ups including Ola, Ola Electric, Chaayos, Shopkirana, Bombay Shaving Company, Lokal, STOA, Entri and others.  After working with a million students in CoCubes I had realized that graduates 'can't change'. They are like a arrow shot from a bow. The more I researched, the more I found that the key to our adult behavior seemed to lie in our childhood. There exists only 'one kind of child' in this world. A child absorbed in doing something without need of praise, reward or fear. But this child is getting lost in our distracted world full of advertisements, candies and screens. And we need to desperately find that child.  After failing to convince my wife to live in the hills, I live in Mumbai with Bhakti and my daughter Diya. And I spend my time being around children and researching on parenting.",,,The Curious Parent,,Founder,,2025-10-03T15:18:53.731Z,,The Curious Parent,82089464,https://www.linkedin.com/company/82089464/,Founder,2022.05,,,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",,,"The Curious Parent Community is now over 1 million parents across Instagram and YouTube.  I find it extremely funny that we live in a world where parenting is taken for granted and a parent knows so little about a child. So I am spending my time in finding the OneKindofChild.   I see my friends running around, making time for kids between calls and presentations. I think parents today are busy, but all of them want the best for their child. Most parents won’t have as much time to spend as I have had.  At the start kids are shaped by their genetics and environment. And the environment (how kids spend their time, who do they play with, which school etc) is determined by the parents.  The idea of the curious parent is to share research on children and parenting which is usable in everyday life.

Given that more than 95% startups close down within 3 years of starting despite the fact that most of the founders are smart, hard working, tech savvy, have industry veterans as mentors and some of them are well funded, it stands to reason that they are facing a systemic rather than a startup specific challenge. Startups are failing as businesses despite very mature and proven business frameworks that work for conventional businesses existing. By leveraging existing business frameworks adapted for startups to help cross the ""5 Chasms""​ that have proven as points of failure for startups. We have adapted these frameworks based on our experience of working with SME and made them an integral part of a business evolution coaching process for startups.  ​  And Startups need to follow a 6 stage business evolution process with clear understanding of work required in each stage. The 6 stages are:   1. Customer Development 2. Establishing the ""Product market fit""​ 3. Discovering the ""Business Model""​ 4. Creating a ""Go To Market Strategy""​  5. Growing the business 6. Scaling the business  ​  We engage deeply with startups and coach them to follow a defined business evolution process using these frameworks.

Here it goes-  I was born and brought up in a small city in India where I first hand witnessed disparity between different classes of society.   In the first few years of my professional career, I tried to bridge those disparities by using the power of finance in catalyzing urban reform. I worked with Governments and Multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to set up financial institutions committed to developing smart infrastructure in Africa and Southeast Asia.  A firm believer in capital for social good and equitable education for every child, I later helped raise funds from individuals, corporations, and foundations for a global nonprofit. My passion for creating social change drove me towards setting up two non-profit organizations that work towards empowering the underprivileged community.   In 2019, I was selected as a part of the LGT fellowship cohort- a group of ten changemakers working around the globe to help create social change. In late 2020, I got sold on the promise of decentralization and permissionless systems spent the next year or so building multiple onchain products and communities. The products I've built have won grants from foundations of all major blockchains.  My vision for the next decade is to build at the frontier of technology and create protocols and structures to bring India and the world onchain.  When I am not talking about bringing the world onchain or sustainable social impact, I am talking about football, rock music, or my cross-country travels.

My experience spans across experimentation, user behavior analytics, and ML modeling.

Whether it’s predicting bounce rates or profiling high-risk defaulters, I’ve worked on solutions that balance accuracy, scale, and clarity.  Outside of work, I’ve built AI tools using LangChain and LLMs, created Q&A bots over documentation, and explored ways to turn unstructured data (like LinkedIn profiles) into structured insights. I also enjoy designing systems from scratch—whether it’s a gamified productivity platform for students or a model pipeline crunching millions of data points.

This search engine takes care of both symmetric and asymmetric matching, multi-lingual utterances, code switching and other nuances of a free-flowing conversation. This runs as an asynchronous ML Pipeline.  2. Signal Management System: This system onboards a customer with a minimal human intervention and within a span of 30 minutes (at max). The system takes customer inputs from a wizard and performs various NLU/NLI validations, domain adaptations (by industries) and generate variations using NLG models and persist them as entitles. Asynchronously it augments it with other information from web, documents and previous recorded calls from the CRM using techniques web-scraping, parsing and clustering .  3. Offline Generation of Cues : This system automatically creates/generates a set of questions and answers tuples for a given organization (B2B customer) using hierarchical knowledge graph, constrained text generation to generate various questions based on intentions/situations and using a reader and retriever model (machine comprehension) to retrieve the answers and persist them. This powers the real time cueing system.  4. ML Pipeline (MLOps) : These are asynchronous ML pipelines which execute about 20 Deep Learning models related to Customer Intelligence, Sales Intelligence and the Onboarding process.

For sparsity of training data used Zero and Few-shot classifiers  6. Selling Best Practices Modules : A system of ML models which quantify the best practices shown by agents during the sales call. They are quantified using series of models for Agent Pitch Score, Conversational (Empathy) Grounding, Engagement Index and Win/Loss prediction model.  7. Multi-lingual Emotion Detection Model : From customer and agent utterances the system detected the emotions with a very high precision. A multi-lingual model XLM-R was fine-tuned on Go-Emotions English corpus and during inference performed a Cross Lingual Transfer on code-switched conversation snippets (Indic and English languages mixed). A lot of complexities are abstracted.

Ctruh is building the world’s first AI-powered Unified XR Commerce Studio, a web-native platform where brands can instantly create, manage, and deploy high-fidelity 3D and AR/VR experiences across web, mobile, and headsets. No apps. No code. No compromise on quality.  At its core is a proprietary 3D engine, built for real-time web rendering, and VersaAI, a generative AI that converts text, images, and videos into interactive 3D assets in minutes. From AI try-ons and 3D configurators to real estate walkthroughs and shoppable storefronts, Ctruh powers a new generation of XR commerce.

Most of them revolve around advancements in data sciences and software engineering.  With my first few internship experiences, I got the opportunity to apply NLP techniques on very interesting problem statements like chatbots and user query automation. I explored state-of-the-art methodologies and honed my machine learning skills while solving them. I naturally felt comfortable in data science, partly due to my majors in mathematics and computing from IIT Kharagpur.   Moving forward, I went on to extend my experience in the corporate world with Fractal Analytics, one of the industry leaders in data analytics services.  From quickly running experiments on my notebooks, I went on to write production-level code and develop MLOps architecture for the whole product at Eugenie.ai, a brainchild of Fractal Analytics. Being an early member of a startup, I got immense exposure in product development, data science, and software engineering. This is where I fell in love with taking sole ownership, building, and delivering quality solutions that create bottom-line impact.  While building Eugenie.ai, I got exposed to best practices for software engineering as well when we built the streaming data ingestion pipeline for sensors which involved writing pub-sub based services.   Running experiments on notebooks and using models in production are two entirely different things. I designed and implemented a full-fledged streaming big-data analytics service which involved creating a scalable MLOps architecture discussed in detail here.  https://eugenie.ai/ai-mlops-deep-learning-models-for-real-time-analytics/  Post Eugenie, I started working with Trell on personalising their user's video feed where we have achieved ~40% improvement in engagement till date.
