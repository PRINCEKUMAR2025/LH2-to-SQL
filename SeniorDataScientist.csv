Now, the same secrets are available to you.",BulletProof Your Startup,14508674,https://www.linkedin.com/company/14508674/,Co-Founder and Partner,2018.01,2020.02,,Bangalore,,,"""Bulletproof Your Startup""​ framework is based on a simple principle. Given that more than 95% startups close down within 3 years of starting despite the fact that most of the founders are smart, hard working, tech savvy, have industry veterans as mentors and some of them are well funded, it stands to reason that they are facing a systemic rather than a startup specific challenge. Startups are failing as businesses despite very mature and proven business frameworks that work for conventional businesses existing. By leveraging existing business frameworks adapted for startups to help cross the ""5 Chasms""​ that have proven as points of failure for startups. We have adapted these frameworks based on our experience of working with SME and made them an integral part of a business evolution coaching process for startups.  ​  And Startups need to follow a 6 stage business evolution process with clear understanding of work required in each stage. The 6 stages are:   1. Customer Development 2. Establishing the ""Product market fit""​ 3. Discovering the ""Business Model""​ 4. Creating a ""Go To Market Strategy""​  5. Growing the business 6. Scaling the business  ​  We engage deeply with startups and coach them to follow a defined business evolution process using these frameworks. This significantly reduces the risk of failure.","Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur",BTech,,1997,2001,Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Designing Growth Strategies : null,Business Growth Strategies : null,Lead Generation : null,Growth Strategies : null,Motivational Speaking : 4,Content Marketing : null,Search Engine Optimization (SEO) : null,Generative AI for Marketing : null,AI for lead : null,Entrepreneurship : 42,Training : 25,Management : 31,Vendor Management : 14,Project Management : 15,Software Project Management : 9,Business Analysis : 8,Business Development : 4,Program Management : 3,Product Management : 2,Leadership : 8,Team Management : 11,Soft Skills : 1,Sales Effectiveness : 1,Emotional Intelligence : 1,Sales Acumen : 1,Diversity Recruitment : 1",,,,,,,,,,https://interviewcracker.com,,,18995,16427

Here it goes-  I was born and brought up in a small city in India where I first hand witnessed disparity between different classes of society.   In the first few years of my professional career, I tried to bridge those disparities by using the power of finance in catalyzing urban reform. I worked with Governments and Multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to set up financial institutions committed to developing smart infrastructure in Africa and Southeast Asia.  A firm believer in capital for social good and equitable education for every child, I later helped raise funds from individuals, corporations, and foundations for a global nonprofit. My passion for creating social change drove me towards setting up two non-profit organizations that work towards empowering the underprivileged community.   In 2019, I was selected as a part of the LGT fellowship cohort- a group of ten changemakers working around the globe to help create social change. In late 2020, I got sold on the promise of decentralization and permissionless systems spent the next year or so building multiple onchain products and communities. The products I've built have won grants from foundations of all major blockchains.  My vision for the next decade is to build at the frontier of technology and create protocols and structures to bring India and the world onchain.  When I am not talking about bringing the world onchain or sustainable social impact, I am talking about football, rock music, or my cross-country travels.

Building Noa, a farm to market wellness platform from India for the globe, 1 NCD at a time.  Why?  1/3 amongst the 140 crores Indians are facing cardiovascular issues, 1/5 Indians are in chronic stress and more than 70% Indians face poor gut health issues. Similar alarming data is present in other non-communicable disease categories as well. One of the major reasons for this is non-fulfillment of daily micros and macros of nutrition. On the supply side, these requirements can be met by plant based functional food, nutraceuticals and the right marriage of building habits & trusted advisory. These plant based nutraceuticals find their key active ingredients sourced directly from the farms hence enabling us to build a purpose driven platform impacting the growers of the country.  Idea Genesis - A) Personal itch - Personally went through a slump of poor health, weighing almost a quintal! Not that I was a novice in fitness, although I did powerlifting during college days yet I was simply unable to hit the gym post subscribing to it twice. It was only after pushing myself for a blood test and correcting B12 & D deficiencies and constantly improving my gut health did I find my way towards losing more than 12 kgs.   B) Farmer Impact - Committed to the vision of impacting farmers and helping them earn better, farm to market is a great lever in the entire agri-food value chain for driving purpose. Chose the difficult way of creating something premium and valuable for the consumers and a win-win for all the farmers as well as the business. C) Market Size - Currently India stands at only 2% market contribution of nutraceuticals on the world level yet it is a $5B market growing at a CAGR of 15% and expected to hit $20B by 2030. US and Europe markets stand at massive $90B and $80B opportunities having high affinity and trust for Indian based nutraceuticals and wellness practices.

I spent countless hours in competitive programming, eventually becoming a Codeforces Expert, winning multiple HackerEarth contests, and clearing Google Code Jam three times. During this time, I was also introduced to Machine Learning — a new field back then — without knowing how big a part it would play in my future career.  IIIT Hyderabad’s project-intensive curriculum gave me hands-on experience across subjects. I built a search engine (Information Retrieval), a custom shell terminal (Operating Systems), orchestrated a distributed cloud environment, and developed projects in sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and more.

At Razorpay, where I served as Associate Director (2019–2024), I led infrastructure transformation initiatives that delivered 62% cloud cost savings and enabled the platform to handle a 30x spike in TPS during high-profile events like IPL and Big Billion Day. By implementing real-time dashboards and auto-scaling strategies, I ensured high availability, reliability, and seamless performance across critical systems.  A core focus of my work has been embedding observability and automation at scale. I successfully onboarded and configured tools such as New Relic, Grafana, and Coralogix across 20+ microservices, improving incident response and reducing MTTD/MTTR through actionable alerts, drift detection, and robust monitoring pipelines. I developed custom dashboards using Prometheus and Grafana for system health, business metrics, and latency, while driving GitHub-based automation to strengthen release workflows. These efforts directly improved developer experience by 30%, reduced PR cycle time from 5 days to under 2, and proactively prevented 70% of financial leakages—cutting monetary loss by 80%.  My technical leadership spans across CI/CD automation, performance engineering, cloud security, and container orchestration. I implemented shift-left security and DDoS protection mechanisms that reduced vulnerabilities by 95%, supported scalable architecture through Kubernetes and Docker, and standardized best practices in observability documentation and runbook creation. I’ve consistently empowered engineering and DevOps teams by closing SDLC gaps, streamlining deployment, and ensuring production stability with measurable results.  Certified in Cyber Security Assessment (LearnTube, 2025), Supervised Machine Learning (Stanford/DeepLearning.AI, 2025), and Generative AI (GrowthSchool, 2024), I continue to explore emerging technologies to solve complex engineering challenges.

Aggois' post harvest products helps farmers opt for higher income channels (private institution buyer, government MSP, ability to store and sell at right time) against default APMC channel and by opting for input on credit financing, they can shun relationship with local money lenders.

From missed flights to buried receipts, I experienced the pain of corporate travel first-hand. And let me tell you...  Business travel is broken.  While consumer travel has evolved by tech, business travel is still stuck in the 90s.  65% of companies still book travel manually using Google Flights or Expedia. (Tech Stack Survey by MostlyMetrics)  > Finance teams spend 14+ business days reconciling travel and card statements.  > Travelers wait 30+ minutes on hold when plans change.  > Most tools are clunky, disconnected, and just… frustrating.  In 2025, business travel is already surpassing pre-pandemic levels.  And it’s only going to increase—thanks to hybrid work, cross-border teams, and the pressure to reconnect.  But here’s the problem:  When businesses finally look to modernize travel, they’re met with legacy platforms issues that ruins a customer experience: > Bad UX — feels like using software from 2003 > Poor automation — booking, reporting, and reimbursements are still manual > Terrible support — stuck with AI bots or long wait times when every second matters  That’s why I co-founded Itilite.  Itilite is the modern, all-in-one platform for corporate travel, expense, and payments.  We’ve reimagined how travel works — for travelers, finance teams, and ops leaders. > Book flights, hotels, and cars on a simple UI > Booking and expense reporting in one-click > Get 24/7 human support that replies in under 30 seconds  Instead of just digitizing the chaos, we eliminate it.  And the results speak for themselves: > A Fortune 500 client reduced reconciliation time from 14 days to 30 minutes > Improved the productivity of 5 full-time travel coordinators by 50% > Trusted by 500+ companies  What do our customers say?: > My travelers get connected to support in 10 seconds—and they handle everything. – Tara Floz, Exactera > As an admin, the platform’s clean, intuitive layout made adding users extremely easy and quick. – Giancaro Valera, JCDecaux  If you’re are tired of juggling tools, messy reconciliation, and emergency calls at 2am—here’s how I can help:  ➡️ Book a demo — I’ll walk you through how we bring all your travel needs into one app with a simple UI and the industry's best support  ➡️ Follow me here — I post free content sharing everything I’ve learned on how to make business travel easy and save costs   A bit about me:  → Proud dog parent of my Labrador, Klay  → NBA junkie  → Never set out to build a company until a fashion e-commerce start-up changed that",,,ITILITE,,Chief Business Officer,,2025-10-07T15:49:43.882Z,,ITILITE,13260577,https://www.linkedin.com/company/13260577/,Founder & Chief Business Officer,2022.06,,,"United States, India",,,"At itilite, we offer a complete SaaS solution for T&E process at companies.

It has been fully hijacked by the politicians exploiting the inherent design flaws of democratic system.  SHORT ELECTORAL CYCLE: Politicians can only think short term & do whatever to win next elections -completely forgetting the fact that the country is FOR EVER.  MEANINGLESS POLICIES: Politicians would like to offer policies like free money to public, tax breaks, false promises etc., to woo voters while completely ignoring the impact on country’s long-term prospects.  SELFISH CONNECTIONS: Parties & their politicians, blindly following “right” or “left” or “green” etc., are connected to special interest groups, corporations and organizations with vested interests. Policies are proposed to serve those masters who provide the vote bank and big funding. Hence as the new party wins the elections, all or most of the policies of previous government are “all of a sudden become useless” & systematically reversed wasting billions of dollars to serve new groups (NOT FOR CANADA or CANADIANS).  GROWW is a non-profit entity with TWO goals to design a new Democratic System:  SHORT TERM: To create awareness so that citizens actively participate in the democratic system to ensure that GOOD PROFESSIONALS are motivated into politics and selected.  LONG TERM: To completely redefine the prevailing democratic system in Canada where the long term (25-50 years) policies are developed PROFESSIONALLY and with ""CANADA FIRST"" approach - NOT by blindly following LEFT or RIGHT or GREEN etc ideologies.  It is sheer stupidity to believe that ALL the problems/issues that Canada is facing can be addressed by thoughtlessly following LEFT or RIGHT or GREEN ideologies.

As a founding member of the ML practice in Salesken, have built and supervised the following use cases.  1. Search Engine : Building a semantic search engine which can match the customer utterances with relevant entities during a sales call and post call analysis so that the agent can serve the customer better. This search engine takes care of both symmetric and asymmetric matching, multi-lingual utterances, code switching and other nuances of a free-flowing conversation. This runs as an asynchronous ML Pipeline.  2. Signal Management System: This system onboards a customer with a minimal human intervention and within a span of 30 minutes (at max). The system takes customer inputs from a wizard and performs various NLU/NLI validations, domain adaptations (by industries) and generate variations using NLG models and persist them as entitles. Asynchronously it augments it with other information from web, documents and previous recorded calls from the CRM using techniques web-scraping, parsing and clustering .  3. Offline Generation of Cues : This system automatically creates/generates a set of questions and answers tuples for a given organization (B2B customer) using hierarchical knowledge graph, constrained text generation to generate various questions based on intentions/situations and using a reader and retriever model (machine comprehension) to retrieve the answers and persist them. This powers the real time cueing system.  4. ML Pipeline (MLOps) : These are asynchronous ML pipelines which execute about 20 Deep Learning models related to Customer Intelligence, Sales Intelligence and the Onboarding process. At a high level the ML pipeline consists of a Publisher and a Subscriber. The subscriber calls those 20 DL models which are running as FastAPI services. This mechanism is handled using callbacks and promises. The pipeline uses Kubernetes cluster and CI/CD using GCP",Salesken,14605626,https://www.linkedin.com/company/14605626/,Technical Architect (SDE- III) Machine Learning,2020.01,2021.08,,"Bengaluru Area, India",,,"In continuation to the projects mentioned above, I have been working very actively and supervising the following modules -  5. Call Summarization Modules : A system of ML models which can summarize a conversation between the sales agent and the customer under certain categories namely Question Detection Model, (Dis)Agreement model, Objection Detection Model, Follow-up Action Detection Model, Conversational Adjacency Pairs (Dialog Act) models and Aspect Based Sentiment models. For sparsity of training data used Zero and Few-shot classifiers  6. Selling Best Practices Modules : A system of ML models which quantify the best practices shown by agents during the sales call. They are quantified using series of models for Agent Pitch Score, Conversational (Empathy) Grounding, Engagement Index and Win/Loss prediction model.  7. Multi-lingual Emotion Detection Model : From customer and agent utterances the system detected the emotions with a very high precision. A multi-lingual model XLM-R was fine-tuned on Go-Emotions English corpus and during inference performed a Cross Lingual Transfer on code-switched conversation snippets (Indic and English languages mixed). A lot of complexities are abstracted.  We published this as a paper titled ""Curriculum learning for adapting models on Code-Mixed Data in Emotion Recognition"" in COLING 2022 (International Conference on Computational Linguistics)  8. Model Optimization : As a continuous improvements to run the DL models in production, we keep optimizing these models using Knowledge Distillation both during Pre-training (Mini or Distil models) and during fine-tuning using Teacher - Student architecture (loss functions) , converting the computational graph into ONNX and running it on dedicated accelerator like ONNX Runtime (ORT) or TensorRT.
